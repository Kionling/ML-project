# Machine Learning Analysis on Lung Cancer 
[Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620#:~:text=Lung%20cancer%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20cancer%20deaths%20worldwide.) - Mayo Clinic

This project uses a Machine Learning approach to understand the different characteristics of patients among a diverse dataset and the correlation between patient features and lung cancer prevalence. 

# Key Features
* Advanced Random Forest algorithm for robust prediction
* In-depth analysis of top predictive factors for lung cancer
* Visualization of results using matplotlib
* Data preprocessing and exploration of a lung cancer dataset


# Main Goal
By analyzing a diverse set of health and lifestyle variables, this model aims to enhance early detection and risk assessment strategies. The model ranks features like age, alcohol consumption, and various other symptoms in order of importance, potentially providing new insights for cancer research. This is a data-driven approach for healthcare experts to make more informed decisions about patient screening and preventive care.
